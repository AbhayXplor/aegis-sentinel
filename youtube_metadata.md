## 📝 Video Description

**[The Hook]**
Managing a crypto treasury shouldn't feel like a security nightmare. Meet Aegis CFO—the first autonomous treasury manager that combines the intelligence of Google Gemini with the ironclad security of on-chain smart contract vaults.

**[The Problem]**
Most DAOs and crypto organizations rely on basic multisigs that are reactive, not proactive. They can't stop "Shadow Spend" or enforce complex business mandates without manual intervention.

**[The Solution]**
Aegis CFO introduces the **AI Policy Engine**. By using **Gemini 2.5 Flash Lite**, we translate natural language business mandates into strict on-chain security policies. Whether it's authorizing payroll or blocking unauthorized transfers to mixers, Aegis acts as your 24/7 autonomous CFO.

**[Key Features]**
✅ **AI Policy Engine**: Configure complex treasury mandates in plain English.
✅ **AegisGuard Smart Contract**: A secure vault that acts as the final arbiter for every transaction.
✅ **Real-Time Threat Monitor**: Visualize and block unauthorized spend attempts before they hit the mempool.
✅ **MNEE Integration**: Native support for the MNEE stablecoin ecosystem.
✅ **Real Mode vs. Demo Mode**: Seamlessly switch between a simulated test environment and live Ethereum (Sepolia) production.

**[Tech Stack]**
- **AI**: Google Gemini 2.0 Flash (gemini-2.5-flash-lite)
- **Blockchain**: Solidity, Ethers.js, Hardhat (Ethereum Sepolia)
- **Frontend**: Next.js 14, Tailwind CSS, Framer Motion
