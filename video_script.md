## 🎙️ Script

### 1. Intro & Landing Page (0:00 - 0:45)
**Visual:** Show the Landing Page. Scroll slowly through the features.
**Audio:** 
"Welcome to Aegis CFO. In the world of on-chain organizations, managing a treasury is high-stakes. Traditional multisigs are great for security, but they’re slow, manual, and lack intelligence. 

Aegis CFO is the first autonomous financial operating system. It’s not just a wallet; it’s an AI-native CFO that manages your payroll, enforces spending policies on-chain, and proactively blocks threats before they happen. 

Before we dive in, a quick note on connectivity: Aegis is production-ready and built to manage real ERC-20 assets like MNEE on the **Ethereum Mainnet** in our **Real Mode**. However, for today’s demonstration, we’ll be using our **Demo Mode**, which is fully integrated with the **Sepolia Testnet**, allowing us to show you the engine in action without risking live capital."

### 2. Dashboard & Demo Mode (Sepolia) (0:45 - 2:00)
**Visual:** Click "Launch App". Ensure **Demo Mode** is active and connected to **Sepolia**. Show the active payroll rules and audit logs.
**Audio:**
"Let’s launch the app. We’re starting in **Demo Mode**, which is fully integrated with the **Sepolia Testnet**. This is where you can see the engine in full gear.

Our dashboard gives you institutional-grade visibility. Notice the 'Recent Activity' and 'Audit Logs'—these are live transactions being monitored by our AI. We have active payroll streams running right now, and you can see the history of successful disbursements and blocked unauthorized attempts. Everything here is live on-chain data from Sepolia, proving the system's end-to-end functionality."

### 3. AI Policy Engine (2:00 - 3:00)
**Visual:** Navigate to the "Policies" view. Type a policy like: *"Limit payroll to 5000 MNEE per week."* Show the AI parsing it and the "Policy Enforcement: 100% Complete" status.
**Audio:**
"The heart of Aegis is the **AI Policy Engine**. Instead of writing complex smart contract code, you simply describe your business mandates in plain English. 

Watch as I define a new policy: 'Limit payroll to 5000 MNEE per week.' Our AI agent parses this intent and prepares it for on-chain enforcement. In this Demo Mode, you can see exactly how these rules are translated into guardrails that the **AegisGuard** contract respects. It’s the perfect blend of AI flexibility and blockchain finality."

### 4. Real Mode: Production Ready (3:00 - 4:30)
**Visual:** Switch to **Real Mode**. Point out the "Mainnet" indicator. Show the Vault, Deposit, and Auto Run settings.
**Audio:**
"Now, let’s talk about **Real Mode**. Aegis CFO is not just a prototype—it is a production-ready product compatible with the **Ethereum Mainnet**. 

In Real Mode, you can manage your actual MNEE treasury. You can **Deposit MNEE** into your secure Vault, move funds between accounts, and set up your **Real-World Payroll Agent**. 

Even without live funds in this demo, you can see the full suite of institutional tools: setting global spending limits, whitelisting specific vendor addresses, and configuring the **Auto Run** safety caps. This is a complete, self-custodial financial operating system ready for any DAO or crypto-native company to deploy today."

### 5. Conclusion & Vision (4:30 - 5:00)
**Visual:** Back to Dashboard or Landing Page.
**Audio:**
"Aegis CFO is more than a tool—it’s a new standard for how organizations manage capital. By combining the speed of AI with the security of MNEE and Ethereum, we’re making autonomous finance a reality. 

Check out our GitHub for the full source code and smart contracts. Thanks for watching, and let’s build the future of finance together."

## 💡 Pro-Tips for Recording:
1.  **Demo Mode (Sepolia) is your "Live Action" segment:** Use this to show actual transactions, policy parsing, and audit logs. It proves the code works.
2.  **Real Mode (Mainnet) is your "Product" segment:** Use this to show the interface and explain how a company would use it for real MNEE. Emphasize that it's "Ready to Deploy."
3.  **Audit Logs:** Keep some "Blocked" logs visible in Demo Mode to show the "Threat Neutralization" in action immediately.
4.  **Cursor Movement:** Use smooth, deliberate cursor movements. Avoid "shaking" the mouse while talking.
